  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={In the present work we describe a novel training scheme for automated radiograph annotation, as used in post-surgical assessment of Total Knee Replacement. As we show experimentally, standard off-the-shelf methods fail to provide high accuracy image annotations for Total Knee Replacement annotation. We instead adopt a U-Net based segmentation style annotator, relax the task by dilating annotations into larger label regions, then progressively erode these label regions back to the base task on a schedule based on training epoch. We demonstrate the advantages of this scheme on a dataset of radiographs with gold-standard expert annotations, comparing against four baseline cases.},

  abstract={This work reports the empirical performance of an automated medical landmark detection method for predict clinical markers in hip radiograph images. Notably, the detection method was trained using a label-only augmentation scheme; our results indicate that this form of augmentation  outperforms traditional data augmentation and produces highly sample efficient estimators. We train a generic U-Net-based architecture under a curriculum consisting of two phases: initially relaxing the landmarking task by enlarging the label points to regions, then gradually eroding these label regions back to the base task. We measure the benefits of this approach on six datasets of radiographs with gold-standard expert annotations.},
