<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My name is Yehyun, and I am a Ph.D. student in [VISE](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/)(Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering) and Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). I am interested in applying machine learning algorithms to medical images.

I am currently doing my research in [VINE Laboratory](https://dcmoyer.github.io/) under the supervision of [Professor Daniel Moyer](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/daniel-moyer). Before my graduate studies, I finished my undergraduate program in Information and Communication Engineering at Dongguk University under the advise of [Professor Woongsup Kim](https://ice.dongguk.edu/professor/list?professor_haggwa_type=PROFH_042).
