I am currently doing my research in [VINE(Vision Information Neuroimaging Engineering) Laboratory](https://vine-lab.notion.site/) under the supervision of [Dr. Daniel Moyer](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/daniel-moyer). I am slso collaborating closely with [Dr. J. Ryan Martin](https://www.vumc.org/ortho/person/ryan-martin-md) in Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
